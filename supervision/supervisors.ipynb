However, in a directed graph it's not possible to calculate it when the graph is not strongly connected (i.e. all nodes are reachable between each other). Nevertheless, I'm only interested in the nodes with the maximum eccentricity, so I define a weak eccentricity (because our directed graph is weakly connected) where an unreachable node is at a distance of zero. This is a great measure to find the people at the top of the tree."
